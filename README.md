```

### Remember to check package.json file for any detail, and especially if you wish to install specific npm package versions (Recommend!)


## Tough Decisions made during Development:

- The use of Tailwindcss: I understand most engineers have reservations when it comes to using CSS frameworks, I do too, but having such less time, I had to make a tough decision. But I would love to discuss with my team on their preferences so as to have a good understanding of our workflow patterns and avoid friction.
- Due to the time constraint, I delegated more time to logic and pleasing typescriptðŸ˜„, hence made a quite interesting but overall good shifted-replica of the [provided picture](which had pointed edges), but I opted for a rounded edge since they were faster to create, and had a more subtle design for a "Simple UI". But I believe I can do better with more time.
